                    <p>
                        I lead a small group of good friends and together we were able to create our first small startup company to raise awareness about marine pollution. 
                        I have already presented the project at AharaiTECH hackathon, "Google for Startups" Israel and "Microsoft Reactor" Tel Aviv.

                    <p>
                        I served as the COO of STARTERIM, a national youth tech-entrepreneurial community managed by youth, for youth. The community connects young entrepreneurs across Israel, providing them with hands-on experience in technology and entrepreneurship even before completing high school. I have led initiatives such as networking events, marketing and branding workshops, and an entrepreneurship competition, all aimed at fostering innovation and collaboration. Under my leadership, the community has expanded its partnerships with organizations like Gav-Yam and TEENK. I also oversaw the development of the community’s new website and facilitated its transition to independent operations, creating new opportunities for our members to gain 21st-century skills. Today, I continue to advise the community's new management team from time to time.

                    <p>
                        I began my journey at Jooba.AI as a Frontend Developer, contributing to developing its youth-oriented e-commerce platform, which prioritizes safety and privacy for teenagers. In September 2024, I transitioned to the role of Social and Community Manager, where I recruited and engaged young entrepreneurs aged 14-18 to establish the platform’s first stores. I have successfully onboarded 40 participants from all over the state. My role also involves fostering an active and inclusive community around the platform, leveraging my leadership skills and experience to empower teens to thrive in the digital marketplace.
